 * default["monitoring"]["alarm_provider"] = "none"
 * default["monitoring"]["procmon_provider"] = "monit"

Valid values for metric provider:

 * "none"
 * "collectd"

Valid values for alarm provider:

 * "none"
 * "collectd"

Valid values for procmon provider:

 * "none"
 * "monit"

Usage
=====

Monitoring
----------

Basically, the concept is that a provider provides best effort
implementions of a variety of metrics and alerts.  This might be
enough for a specific implementation, but if more monitoring is
desired, it can be layered on top of the monitoring provided by the
openstack cookbooks.  For example, to use a monitoring package or
alerting package not offered by this provider, the monitoring defaults
could be set to "none", and a completely different monitoring system
could be dropped in on top.

Or, it could be set to collectd, and then layer additional
environment-specific monitoring on top of the existing collectd
monitoring.

Either way, the objective is to provide a simple baseline monitoring
that can be overriden or enhanced.

To use a monitoring provider, set the appropriate provider using the
attributes above, and then create a monitoring definition:

    monitoring_metric "syslog" do
      type "syslog"
    end

Valid types include:

 * syslog
 * cpu
 * disk
 * interface
 * memory
 * swap
 * load

In addition, there is a "pyscript" provider that in the case of collectd
expects a collectd python plugin:

    monitoring_metric "cluster-stats" do
      type "pyscript"
      script "cluster-stats.py"
    end

In this format, it will generate cluster-stats.py in the appropriate
provider-specific location from a cookbook_file.  If the script ends
with ".erb", it will template it, using any options provided.
Example:

    monitoring_metric "cluster-stats" do
      type "pyscript"
      script "cluster-stats.py.erb"
      options("endpoint" => "http://localhost:8080/" ... )
    end

In the future, it would be groovy to make arbitrary scripts in
arbitrary languages that emit data in "key=value" format, and convert
that output format to the format that the concrete monitoring provider
can use.  Patches gratefully accepted.  Also for new providers, obviously.

Procmon
-------

Process monitoring currently is implemented with monit, but could be
done using supervisord, or one of the goofy ruby process monitors or
whatever.

The "monit" implementation does no alerting, instead relying on the
alerting provider to provide alerts of processes not running.  Monit
in this case is strictly for the purposes of trying valiently to
restart stuff.  On repeated failure, it just gives up and lets the
alerting system raise a ticket or whatever your backend alerting
system does.

Example:

    # matching a process name
    monitoring_procmon "apache" do
      process_name "apache2"
      start_cmd "/etc/init.d/apache2 start"
      stop_cmd "/etc/init.d/apache2 stop"
    end

    # using a pid file
    monitoring_procmon "apache" do
      pid_file "/var/run/httpd.pid"
      start_cmd "/etc/init.d/apache2 start"
      stop_cmd "/etc/init.d/apache2 stop"
    end

It's possible to tune this further using the monit cookbook, but this
basically just does the defaults.  Again, with the welcoming patches.

Alerting
--------

Not complete yet.... please wait.
